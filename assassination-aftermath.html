<p>On <time datetime="1968-03-29">March 29, 1968</time>, King went to Memphis, Tennessee, in support of the black sanitary public works employees. On <time datetime="1968-04-03">April 3</time>, King addressed a rally and delivered his "I've Been to the Mountaintop" address. King's flight to Memphis had been delayed by a bomb threat against his plane. In the close of the last speech of his career, in reference to the bomb threat, King said the following:</p>

<p><i class="quote">"And then I got to Memphis. And some began to say the threats, or talk about the threats that were out. What would happen to me from some of our sick white brothers?

Well, I don't know what will happen now. We've got some difficult days ahead. But it doesn't matter with me now. Because I've been to the mountaintop. And I don't mind. Like anybody, I would like to live a long life. Longevity has its place. But I'm not concerned about that now. I just want to do God's will. And He's allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I've looked over. And I've seen the promised land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the promised land. So I'm happy, tonight. I'm not worried about anything. I'm not fearing any man. Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord."</i></p>

<p>King was booked in the Lorraine Motel in Memphis. King was shot by <b class="people">James Earl Ray</b> at 6:01 p.m., <time datetime="1968-04-04">April 4, 1968</time>, as he stood on the motel's second-floor balcony. The bullet entered through his right cheek, smashing his jaw, then traveled down his spinal cord before lodging in his shoulder. After emergency chest surgery, King died at St. Joseph's Hospital at 7:05 p.m. According to biographer Taylor Branch, King's autopsy revealed that though only 39 years old, he "had the heart of a 60 year old", which Branch attributed to the stress of 13 years in the Civil Rights Movement.</p>

<p>The assassination led to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_assassination_riots">nationwide wave of race riots</a> in Washington, <abbr title="District of Columbia" aria-label="District of Columbia">D.C.</abbr>, Chicago, Baltimore, Louisville, Kansas City, and dozens of other cities. Presidential candidate <b class="people">Robert F. "Bobby" Kennedy</b> gave a short speech to the gathering of supporters informing them of the tragedy and urging them to continue King's ideal of nonviolence. <b class="people">James Farmer <abbr title="Junior" aria-label="Junior">Jr.</abbr></b>, and other civil rights leaders also called for non-violent action, while the more militant <b>Stokely Carmichael</b> called for a more forceful response. The city of Memphis quickly settled the strike on terms favorable to the sanitation workers.</p>

<p>President <b class="people">Lyndon B. Johnson</b> declared <time datetime="1968-04-07">April 7</time> a national day of mourning for the civil rights leader. Vice President <b class="people">Hubert Humphrey</b> attended King's funeral on behalf of the President, as there were fears that Johnson's presence might incite protests and perhaps violence. </p>

<p>Two months after King's death, escaped convict James Earl Ray was captured while trying to leave the United Kingdom on a false Canadian passport. Ray was quickly extradited to Tennessee and charged with King's murder. He confessed to the assassination on <time datetime="1969-03-10">March 10, 1969</time>, though he recanted this confession three days later. On the advice of his attorney, Ray pleaded guilty to avoid a trial conviction and the possibility of receiving the death penalty. He was sentenced to a 99-year prison term. Ray later claimed a man he met in Montreal, Quebec, with the alias "Raoul", was involved and that the assassination was the result of a conspiracy. He spent the remainder of his life attempting, unsuccessfully, to withdraw his guilty plea and secure the trial he never had.</p>
