<p>
King's main legacy was to secure progress on civil rights in the U.S. Just days after King's assassination, Congress passed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1968">Civil Rights Act of 1968</a>. <strong>Title VIII of the Act, commonly known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Housing_Act">Fair Housing Act</a>, prohibited discrimination in housing and housing-related transactions on the basis of race, religion, or national origin (later expanded to include sex, familial status, and disability)</strong>. This legislation was seen as a tribute to King's struggle in his final years to combat residential discrimination in the U.S.</p>

<p>Internationally, King's legacy includes influences on the Black Consciousness Movement and Civil Rights Movement in South Africa. King's work was cited by and served as an inspiration for South African leader <b class="people">Albert Lutuli</b>, who fought for racial justice in his country and was later awarded the Nobel Prize. The day following King's assassination, school teacher <b class="people">Jane Elliott</b> conducted her first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Elliott">"Blue Eyes/Brown Eyes"</a> exercise with her class of elementary school students in Riceville, Iowa. Her purpose was to help them understand King's death as it related to racism, something they little understood as they lived in a predominantly white community. King has become a national icon in the history of American liberalism and American progressivism.</p>

<p>King's wife, <b class="people">Coretta Scott King</b>, followed in her husband's footsteps and was active in matters of social justice and civil rights until her death in 2006. The same year that Martin Luther King was assassinated, she established the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Center_for_Nonviolent_Social_Change">King Center</a> in Atlanta, Georgia, dedicated to preserving his legacy and the work of championing nonviolent conflict resolution and tolerance worldwide. Their son, <b class="people">Dexter King</b>, serves as the center's chairman. Daughter <b class="people">Yolanda King</b>, who died in 2007, was a motivational speaker, author and founder of Higher Ground Productions, an organization specializing in diversity training.</p>

<p><time datetime="1968-02-04">On February 4, 1968</time>, at the Ebenezer Baptist Church, in speaking about how he wished to be remembered after his death, King stated:</p>

<p> <i class="quote">"I'd like somebody to mention that day that Martin Luther King Jr. tried to give his life serving others. I'd like for somebody to say that day that Martin Luther King Jr. tried to love somebody.</i></p>

<p> <i class="quote">I want you to say that day that I tried to be right on the war question. I want you to be able to say that day that I did try to feed the hungry. I want you to be able to say that day that I did try in my life to clothe those who were naked. I want you to say on that day that I did try in my life to visit those who were in prison. And I want you to say that I tried to love and serve humanity.</i></p>

<p> <i class="quote">Yes, if you want to say that I was a drum major. Say that I was a drum major for justice. Say that I was a drum major for peace. I was a drum major for righteousness. And all of the other shallow things will not matter. I won't have any money to leave behind. I won't have the fine and luxurious things of life to leave behind. But I just want to leave a committed life behind."</i></p>
