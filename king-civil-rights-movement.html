<h3>Montgomery bus boycott, 1955</h3>
<p>On <time datetime="1955-12-01">December 1, 1955</time>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_Parks"><b class="people">Rosa Parks</b></a> was arrested for refusing to give up her seat on a city bus. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_bus_boycott">Montgomery Bus Boycott</a>, urged and planned by <b class="people">Edgar Daniel Nixon</b> and led by King, soon followed. <strong>The boycott lasted for 385 days, and the situation became so tense that King's house was bombed. King was arrested during this campaign, which concluded with a United States District Court ruling in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browder_v._Gayle"><i>Browder v. Gayle</i></a> that ended racial segregation on all Montgomery public buses. King's role in the bus boycott transformed him into a national figure and the best-known spokesman of the civil rights movement.</strong>

<h3>Albany Movement, 1961-1962</h3>
<p>The Albany Movement was a desegregation coalition formed in Albany, Georgia, in November 1961. The movement mobilized thousands of citizens for a broad-front nonviolent attack on every aspect of segregation within the city and attracted nationwide attention. King first visited on <time datetime="1961-12-15">December 15, 1961</time>, and the following day was swept up in a mass arrest of peaceful demonstrators. He declined bail until the city made concessions. According to King, <i class="quote">"that agreement was dishonored and violated by the city"</i> after he left town.</p>

<p>After nearly a year of intense activism with few tangible results, the movement began to deteriorate. Divisions within the black community and the canny, low-key response by local government defeated efforts. The national media was highly critical of King's role in the defeat, and the <abbr title="Southern Christian Leadership Conference" aria-label="Southern Christian Leadership Conference">SCLC</abbr>'s lack of results contributed to a growing gulf between the organization and the more radical Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (<abbr title="Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee" aria-label="Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee">SNCC</abbr>).</p>

<h3>Birmingham Campaign, 1963</h3>
<p>
In April 1963, the <abbr title="Southern Christian Leadership Conference" aria-label="Southern Christian Leadership Conference">SCLC</abbr> began a campaign against racial segregation and economic injustice in Birmingham, Alabama. The campaign used nonviolent but intentionally confrontational tactics, developed in part by <b class="people"><abbr title="Reverend" aria-label="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Wyatt Tee Walker</b>. Black people in Birmingham, organizing with the <abbr title="Southern Christian Leadership Conference" aria-label="Southern Christian Leadership Conference">SCLC</abbr>, occupied public spaces with marches and sit-ins, openly violating laws that they considered unjust.</p>

<p>King's intent was to provoke mass arrests and <i class="quote">"create a situation so crisis-packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation"</i>. However, the campaign's early volunteers did not succeed in shutting down the city, or in drawing media attention to the police's actions. Over the concerns of an uncertain King, <abbr title="Southern Christian Leadership Conference" aria-label="Southern Christian Leadership Conference">SCLC</abbr> strategist <b class="people">James Bevel</b> changed the course of the campaign by recruiting children and young adults to join in the demonstrations. Newsweek called this strategy a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Crusade_(1963)">Children's Crusade.</a></p>

<p>During the protests, the Birmingham Police Department, led by <b class="people">Eugene "Bull" Connor</b>, used high-pressure water jets and police dogs against protesters, including children. Footage of the police response was broadcast on national television news and dominated the nation's attention, shocking many white Americans and consolidating black Americans behind the movement. Not all of the demonstrators were peaceful, despite the avowed intentions of the <abbr title="Southern Christian Leadership Conference" aria-label="Southern Christian Leadership Conference">SCLC</abbr>. In some cases, bystanders attacked the police, who responded with force. King and the <abbr title="Southern Christian Leadership Conference" aria-label="Southern Christian Leadership Conference">SCLC</abbr> were criticized for putting children in harm's way. <strong>But the campaign was a success: Connor lost his job, the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws">Jim Crow</a>" signs came down, and public places became more open to blacks. King's reputation improved immensely.</strong></p>

<p>King was arrested and jailed early in the campaign—his 13th arrest out of 29. From his cell, he composed the now-famous letter from Birmingham Jail which responds to calls on the movement to pursue legal channels for social change. King argues that the crisis of racism is too urgent, and the current system too entrenched: <i class="quote">"We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed."</i> He points out that the Boston Tea Party, a celebrated act of rebellion in the American colonies, was illegal civil disobedience, and that, conversely, <i class="quote">"everything Adolf Hitler did in Germany was 'legal'"</i>. King also expresses his frustration with white moderates and clergymen too timid to oppose an unjust system:</p>

<p><i class="quote">"I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Councilor or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to "order" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: "I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action"; who paternalistic-ally believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a "more convenient season".</i></p>

<h3>March on Washington, 1963</h3>
<p>King, representing the <abbr title="Southern Christian Leadership Conference" aria-label="Southern Christian Leadership Conference">SCLC</abbr>, was among the leaders of the "Big Six" civil rights organizations who were instrumental in the organization of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which took place on <time datetime="1963-08-28">August 28, 1963</time>. The other leaders and organizations comprising the Big Six were <b class="people">Roy Wilkins</b> from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Colored_People">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People <abbr title="National Association for the Advancement of Colored People" aria-label="National Association for the Advancement of Colored People">(NAACP)</abbr></a>; <b class="people">Whitney Young</b>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Urban_League">National Urban League</a>; <b class="people">A. Philip Randolph</b>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotherhood_of_Sleeping_Car_Porters">Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters</a>; <b class="people">John Lewis</b>, <abbr title="Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee" aria-label="Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee">SNCC</abbr>; and <b class="people">James L. Farmer <abbr title="Junior" aria-label="Junior">Jr.</abbr></b>, of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Racial_Equality">Congress of Racial Equality</a>.</p>

<p>For King, this role was another which courted controversy, since he was one of the key figures who acceded to the wishes of United States President <b class="people">John F. Kennedy</b> in changing the focus of the march. Kennedy initially opposed the march outright, because he was concerned it would negatively impact the drive for passage of civil rights legislation. However, the organizers were firm that the march would proceed. With the march going forward, the Kennedys decided it was important to work to ensure its success. </p>

<p>The march originally was conceived as an event to dramatize the desperate condition of blacks in the southern U.S. and an opportunity to place organizers' concerns and grievances squarely before the seat of power in the nation's capital. Organizers intended to denounce the federal government for its failure to safeguard the civil rights and physical safety of civil rights workers and blacks. However, the group acquiesced to presidential pressure and influence, and the event ultimately took on a far less strident tone. As a result, some civil rights activists felt it presented an inaccurate, sanitized pageant of racial harmony; <b class="people">Malcolm X</b> called it the "Farce on Washington", and the Nation of Islam forbade its members from attending the march.</p>

        <p>The march did, however, make specific demands:</p> 
    <ul>
        <li>An end to racial segregation in public schools</li>
        <li>Meaningful civil rights legislation, including a law prohibiting racial discrimination in employment</li> 
        <li>Protection of civil rights workers from police brutality</li> 
        <li>A $2 minimum wage for all workers</li> 
        <li>Self-government for Washington, D.C., then governed by congressional committee.</li></ul> 
    <p>Despite tensions, the march was a resounding success. More than a quarter of a million people of diverse ethnicities attended the event, sprawling from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial onto the National Mall and around the reflecting pool. At the time, it was the largest gathering of protesters in Washington, D.C.'s history.</p>

<p>King delivered a 17-minute speech, later known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Have_a_Dream">"I Have a Dream"</a>. In the speech's most famous passage—in which he departed from his prepared text, possibly at the prompting of <b class="people">Mahalia Jackson</b>, who shouted behind him, <i class="quote">"Tell them about the dream!"</i>—King said:</p>

<p><i class="quote">"I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.
I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal.'
I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.
I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.
I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.
I have a dream today.
I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification; one day right there in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.
    I have a dream today."</i></p>

<audio src="mlk-dream.mp3" controls></audio>

<p>"I Have a Dream" came to be regarded as one of the finest speeches in the history of American oratory. The March, and especially King's speech, helped put civil rights at the top of the agenda of reformers in the United States and facilitated passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

<h3>Selma voting rights movement and "Bloody Sunday", 1965</h3>
<p>Acting on <b class="people">James Bevel</b>'s call for a march from Selma to Montgomery, King, Bevel, and the <abbr title="Southern Christian Leadership Conference" aria-label="Southern Christian Leadership Conference">SCLC</abbr>, in partial collaboration with <abbr title="Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee" aria-label="Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee">SNCC</abbr>, attempted to organize the march to the state's capital. The first attempt to march on <time datetime="1965-03-07">March 7, 1965</time>, was aborted because of mob and police violence against the demonstrators. This day has become known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selma_to_Montgomery_marches#.22Bloody_Sunday.22_events">Bloody Sunday</a> and was a major turning point in the effort to gain public support for the Civil Rights Movement. It was the clearest demonstration up to that time of the dramatic potential of King's nonviolence strategy. King, however, was not present. He did not attend the march due to church duties, but he later wrote, <i class="quote">"If I had any idea that the state troopers would use the kind of brutality they did, I would have felt compelled to give up my church duties altogether to lead the line."</i> Footage of police brutality against the protesters was broadcast extensively and aroused national public outrage.</p>

<p>King next attempted to organize a march for <time datetime="1965-03-09">March 9</time>. The <abbr title="Southern Christian Leadership Conference" aria-label="Southern Christian Leadership Conference">SCLC</abbr> petitioned for an injunction in federal court against the State of Alabama; this was denied and the judge issued an order blocking the march until after a hearing. Nonetheless, King led marchers on March 9 to the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, then held a short prayer session before turning the marchers around and asking them to disperse so as not to violate the court order. The unexpected ending of this second march aroused the surprise and anger of many within the local movement. The march finally went ahead fully on <time datetime="1965-03-25">March 25, 1965</time>. At the conclusion of the march on the steps of the state capitol, King delivered a speech that became known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Long,_Not_Long">"How Long, Not Long"</a>. In it, King stated that equal rights for African Americans could not be far away, <i class="quote">"because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice"</i>.
