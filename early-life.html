King was born on <time datetime="1928-01-15">January 15, 1929</time>, in Atlanta, Georgia. King's legal name at birth was <b class="people">Michael King</b>, and his father was also born Michael King, but the elder King changed his and his son's names following a 1934 trip to Germany to attend the Fifth Baptist World Alliance Congress in Berlin. It was during this time he chose to be called Martin Luther King in honor of the German reformer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther"><b class="people">Martin Luther.</b></a></p>

<p>Growing up in Atlanta, King attended Booker T. Washington High School. He became known for his public speaking ability and was part of the school's debate team. During his junior year, he won first prize in an oratorical contest sponsored by the Negro Elks Club in Dublin, Georgia. Returning home to Atlanta by bus, he and his teacher were ordered by the driver to stand so that white passengers could sit down. King initially refused, but complied after his teacher told him that he would be breaking the law if he did not submit. King said that during this incident, he was, <i class="quote">"the angriest I have ever been in my life."</i></p>

<p>During King's junior year in high school, Morehouse College, a respected historically black college, announced that it would accept any high school juniors who could pass its entrance exam. At the age of 15, King passed the exam and entered Morehouse. The summer before his last year at Morehouse, in 1947, the 18-year-old King chose to enter the ministry. He had concluded that the church offered the most assuring way to answer <i class="quote">an inner urge to serve humanity."</i> King's "inner urge" had begun developing, and he made peace with the Baptist Church, as he believed he would be a "rational" minister with sermons that were <i class="quote">"a respectful force for ideas, even social protest."</i></p>

<p>In 1948, he graduated from Morehouse with a <abbr title="Bachelor of Arts" aria-label="Bachelor of Arts">B.A.</abbr> in Sociology and enrolled in Crozer Theological Seminary in Chester, Pennsylvania, from which he graduated with a <abbr title="Bachelor of Divinity" aria-label="Bachelor of Divinity">B.Div.</abbr> degree in 1951.</p>

<p>At age 25 in 1954, King was called as pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama.</p>
